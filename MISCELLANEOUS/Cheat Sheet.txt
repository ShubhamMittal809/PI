0 Hornor's Method to evalute polynomial

	- Horner’s method can be used to evaluate polynomial in O(n) time. 
	- To understand the method, let us consider the example of 2x^3 – 6x^2 + 2x – 1. 
	- The polynomial can be evaluated as ((2x – 6)x + 2)x – 1. 
	- The idea is to initialize result as coefficient of xn which is 2 in this case, 
	- repeatedly multiply result with x and add next coefficient to result. Finally return result.

1 Minimum No of Platforms Required for a Railway Station

	- We can solve the above problem in O(nLogn) time. 
	- The idea is to consider all evens in sorted order. 
	- Once we have all events in sorted order, we can trace the number of trains at any time keeping track of trains that have arrived, but not departed.		

2. Factorial of Large number
	
	- Factorial of 100 has 158 digits. It is not possible to store these many digits even if we use long long int. 
	- So we use array to store the result
	
	- How to multiply a number ‘x’ with the number stored in res[]?
	
	- The idea is to use simple school mathematics. 
	- We one by one multiply x with every digit of res[]. 
	- The important point to note here is digits are multiplied from rightmost digit to leftmost digit. 
	- If we store digits in same order in res[], then it becomes difficult to update res[] without extra space. 
	- That is why res[] is maintained in reverse way, i.e., digits from right to left are stored.
