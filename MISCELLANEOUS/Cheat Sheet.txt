0 Hornor's Method to evalute polynomial

	- Horner’s method can be used to evaluate polynomial in O(n) time. 
	- To understand the method, let us consider the example of 2x^3 – 6x^2 + 2x – 1. 
	- The polynomial can be evaluated as ((2x – 6)x + 2)x – 1. 
	- The idea is to initialize result as coefficient of xn which is 2 in this case, 
	- repeatedly multiply result with x and add next coefficient to result. Finally return result.

1 Minimum No of Platforms Required for a Railway Station

	- We can solve the above problem in O(nLogn) time. 
	- The idea is to consider all evens in sorted order. 
	- Once we have all events in sorted order, we can trace the number of trains at any time keeping track of trains that have arrived, but not departed.
