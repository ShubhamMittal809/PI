0 Deletion from BST:- 1).If node is Leafe Node, 2).If node has only one child, 3).If node has both child(get max ele from left subtree or min from right subtree)

1 Inorder predecessor and successor  BST:-

	- While Traversing Left keep track of prev node for Successor
	- While Traversing right keep track of prev node for Predecessor
	
	Handle Cases like :- Leafe node, left child null, right child null, root

2 Check if a binary tree is BST or not:- Set Boundary limits of min and max(initially INT_MIN & INT_MAX), traverse and set limits.

3 Find k-th smallest element in BST:- Modify inorder traversal by using static member count and find node

4 Insert & Deletion from BST- Iterative:- Use goto statement
