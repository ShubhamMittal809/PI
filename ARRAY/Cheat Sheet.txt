15 Minimum Length Unsorted Sub-array:-

	1) Find the candidate unsorted subarray
		a) Scan from left to right and find the first element which is greater than the next element. Let s be the index of such an element.
		b) Scan from right to left and find the first element (first in right to left order) which is smaller than the next element (next in right to left order). Let e be the index of such an element
	
	2) Check whether sorting the candidate unsorted subarray makes the complete array sorted or not. If not, then include more elements in the subarray.
		a) Find the minimum and maximum values in arr[s..e]. Let minimum and maximum values be min and max.
		b) Find the first element (if there is any) in arr[0..s-1] which is greater than min, change s to index of this element.
		c) Find the last element (if there is any) in arr[e+1..n-1] which is smaller than max, change e to index of this element.
	
	3) Print s and e.

16 Largest Sub-Array with Equal no of 1s & 0s:-

	1) Consider all 0 values as -1. The problem now reduces to find out the maximum length subarray with sum = 0.
	2) Create a temporary array sumleft[] of size n. Store the sum of all elements from arr[0] to arr[i] in sumleft[i]. This can be done in O(n) time.
	3) There are two cases, the output subarray may start from 0th index or may start from some other index. We will return the max of the values obtained by two cases.
	4) To find the maximum length subarray starting from 0th index, scan the sumleft[] and find the maximum i where sumleft[i] = 0.
	5) Now, we need to find the subarray where subarray sum is 0 and start index is not 0. This problem is equivalent to finding two indexes i & j in sumleft[] such that sumleft[i] = sumleft[j] and j-i is maximum. To solve this, we can create a hash table with size = max-min+1 where min is the minimum value in the sumleft[] and max is the maximum value in the sumleft[]. The idea is to hash the leftmost occurrences of all different values in sumleft[]. The size of hash is chosen as max-min+1 because there can be these many different possible values in sumleft[]. Initialize all values in hash as -1
	6) To fill and use hash[], traverse sumleft[] from 0 to n-1. If a value is not present in hash[], then store its index in hash. If the value is present, then calculate the difference of current index of sumleft[] and previously stored value in hash[]. If this difference is more than maxsize, then update the maxsize.
	7) To handle corner cases (all 1s and all 0s), we initialize maxsize as -1. If the maxsize remains -1, then print there is no such subarray.


17 Print all distinct permutations of a given string:-

    1. Find the largest index k such that a[k] < a[k + 1]. If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.
    2. Find the largest index l greater than k such that a[k] < a[l].
    3. Swap the value of a[k] with that of a[l].
    4. Reverse the sequence from a[k + 1] up to and including the final element a[n].

18 Print k Combination of Array size n:-

	Example:- Array = {A,B,C}, Here	n = 3, k = 2
	
	A B C
	0 1 2
	
	- Initialize Index sequence array with initial indices
	- First index sequence will be [0,1] as i said [0, 1, 2, ... , k - 1].
	- On the second step it switches to [0,2] as i said [0, 1, 2,..., k] increament last index.
	- The last possible sequence will be [1,2] as i said [n - k - 1, n - k - 2, ..., n - 1] increament last index which exceeds limit of n so we go to index last - 1 & increament on goint index by one.
	

19 Find a sorted subsequence of size 3 in linear time:-

	1) Create an auxiliary array smaller[0..n-1]. 
		smaller[i] should store the index of a number which is smaller than arr[i] and is on left side of arr[i]. smaller[i] should contain -1 if there is no such element.
	2) Create another auxiliary array greater[0..n-1]. 
		greater[i] should store the index of a number which is greater than arr[i] and is on right side of arr[i]. greater[i] should contain -1 if there is no such element.
	3) Finally traverse both smaller[] and greater[] and find the index i for which both smaller[i] and greater[i] are not -1.
	
20 Two elements whose sum is closest to zero:-

	1) Sort all the elements of the input array.
	2) Use two index variables l and r to traverse from left and right ends respectively. Initialize l as 0 and r as n-1.
	3) sum = a[l] + a[r]
	4) If sum is -ve, then l++
	5) If sum is +ve, then r–
	6) Keep track of abs min sum.
	7) Repeat steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 while l < r Implementation
		
	Note: when you find value nearest to zero you have to take absolute value
