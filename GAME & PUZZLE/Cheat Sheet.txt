1 Tower of Hanoi Iterative

	# Algorithm:
	
		1. Calculate the total number of moves required i.e. "pow(2, n)- 1" here n is number of disks.

		2. for i = 1 to total number of moves:
		     if i%3 == 1: movement between source and destination pole
		     if i%3 == 2: movement between source and auxiliary pole
		     if i%3 == 0: movement between auxiliary and destination pole
		     
	# Cheat:- Formulating Algo with 2 Disk simulation
	
	
	- Initial 	- Step 1: Move A to B	- Step 2: Move A to C	- Step 3: Move B to C	- Step 4: Repeat this 3 steps untill 2^N -1 times
