> **What is mean by square root of any no?**
- It means that one of its factor will be less than square root of no & one will be larger.
- For example: N = 36, square root of N = 6;
all the factor of 36 are
18 x 2  = 36
12 x 3  = 36
9 x 4   = 36
6 x 6   = 36
So, square root is wokring like partition of two factor of given N.
