> **What is mean by square root of any no?**
- It means that one of its factor will be less than square root of no & one will be larger.
- For example: N = 36, square root of N = 6; all the factor of 36 are

1. 18 x 2  = 36
2. 12 x 3  = 36
3. 9 x 4   = 36
4. 6 x 6   = 36
  
So, square root is wokring like partition of two factor of given N.
