## Number Theory

> **Prime number**
- Its whole number unlike composite number which made up different factors.
- Even nos can't be prime except 2.
- If you plot the fibonacci numbers in spiral form, all diagonals are prime nos.
- Primes are used in cryptography coz you can not generate combination or patterns out of it so wont be decrypted easily.

> **What is mean by square root of any no?**
- It means that one of its factor will be less than square root of no & one will be larger.
- For example: N = 36, square root of N = 6; all the factor of 36 are

1. 18 x 2  = 36
2. 12 x 3  = 36
3. 9 x 4   = 36
4. 6 x 6   = 36
  
So, square root is wokring like partition of two factor of given N.

> **Sieve of eratosthenes**
1. Brute force 
2. Square root optimization
3. Square of no optimization

> **Segmented Sieve**
- For example: All primes b/w 25 to 36
- Step 1: Find all primes upto square root of ‘n’(upper bound)  
- Step 2: Cancell all no b/w 25 to 36 which are divisible by prime found in step 1

> **Euclid's algo for GCD**
- GCD(a,b) = GCD(b, a%b)
- GCD(a,0) = a

> **LCM**
- GCD(a,b) x LCM(a,b) = a x b

> **Misc**
- coprime = gcd is 1
