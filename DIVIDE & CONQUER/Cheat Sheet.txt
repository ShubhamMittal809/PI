1. Power Function in LogN time :- 

				  2^4
				/	 \
			2^2		  2^2
		   /	\	/	 \
	    2^1	  2^1 2^1    2^1

2. Counting Inversion :- Use Merge Sort and count number of element is in right half which is greater than left half

3. Closest Pair of Points:-

		1) We sort all points according to x coordinates.
		
		2) Divide all points in two halves.
		
		3) Recursively find the smallest distances in both subarrays.
		
		4) Take the minimum of two smallest distances. Let the minimum be d.
		
		5) Create an array strip[] that stores all points which are at most d distance away from the middle line dividing the two sets.
		
		6) Find the smallest distance in strip[].
		
		7) Return the minimum of d and the smallest distance calculated in above step 6.
